Uncertainty in DL Miniproject

Contains my own implementation of VCL and a modified implementation of MVG-VI taken from https://github.com/AMLab-Amsterdam/SEVDL_MGP

See the Generate Data folder for permuted MNIST and single-headed split MNIST. 
For permuted MNIST, their permutations are stored in JSON, so you can reproduce the datasets exactly. There is code to generate the pkl files, but these are too large to commit (without using LFS)
